LgLcd.NET Library
------------------------------

Update from Wintaru:
I tried contacting hobbit125 below as this library was broken with the newever version of the Logitech 
LCD software but never received a response. I went ahead and updated his work and give him full credit 
for the intial work done.

Thank you for downloading and taking interest in this .net wrapper for the LgLcd 
library used in developing applications for the Logitech G-Series keyboards.


This library includes source directories and binary dll files for the following 2 
libraries.

LgLcd.dll 
	This is a simple Dll wrapper for the static libraries (.lib) files supplied by
	logitech.  This is needed since c# is much easier to interface with .dll files than
	it is to interface with static libraries.

	You can use this dll with other languages that interface easily with a DLL file.
	Because of this, this simple dll provides support for future development of libraries/modules
	to support many other languages.

LgLcd.NET.dll	
	This is the .NET Dll library.  You can reference this and use it directly in a .NET
	project to develop applications for Logitech G-Series keyboards.  This is basically just
	a .NET wrapper around the dll above.

We wrap once for a language-agnostic win32 library.  Then we wrap that language-agnostic win32 library
with a .NET module providing exposed native .NET functions for accessing the DLL.

Anyway, to make your own LGLCD.NET application using these libraries:
	- open VS.NET (or VS.NET express)
	- create a new .NET project in your language of choice
	- copy the LgLcd.dll and LgLcd.NET.dll files to your project directory
	- Add a .NET reference in the project to the LgLcd.NET.dll file
	- Develop your application. 

At this point I maintain this library by myself, so please be patient with regards to updates and
responses to questions and emails.  With that said, I do welcome any comments, suggestions,
demo applications to include, ports to other languages from the dll, etc.

I hope that everyone finds good use with this, and hopefully this will give you even
more excuse for buying one of those neat glowy G15 keyboards ;)
